/*
One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their
gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a
total of $650. Develop a program that will input each salespersonâ€™s gross sales for the last week and will calculate and display that
salesperson's earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a time. Here is a sample input/output dialog:
1 Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 5000.00
2 Salary is: $650.00
3
4 Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 1234.56
5 Salary is: $311.11
6
7 Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 1088.89
8 Salary is: $298.00
9
10 Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): -1
